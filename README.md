# Limestone
This is a Roblox DLL that I decided to write in my freetime because I'm bored. This is a simple script executor (as of right now, there is no communication layer, but it can run more than print). I'm going to add more to this in the future.

# What is going to be added next?
* Custom functions (lua_setfield and lua_pushcclosure will be added to make this possible)
* A communcation bridge and simple UI
* Loadstring support
* game:HttpGet support
